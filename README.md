# Semisupervised Clustering

This repository contains the code for semi-supervised clustering developed for Master Thesis: "Automatic analysis of images from camera-traps" by Michal Nazarczuk from Imperial College London

The algorithm is inspired with DCEC method ([Deep Clustering with Convolutional Autoencoders](https://xifengguo.github.io/papers/ICONIP17-DCEC.pdf)). The main change adds "labelling" loss (cross-entropy between labelled examples and their predictions) as the loss component.
